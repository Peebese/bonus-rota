5. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Identify area of lag.  Try to replicate the issue on a similar server, e.g. staging. Look at the infrastructure.
Identify if the performance is server side or scripting. Look at page weight. Look as ways to increase performance, e.g. cache, queue system.
